I append \"True\" or \"False\" values, which check whether any of the numbers divide evenly into the number I'm checking.

If every smaller number is not a factor, then the list returns all True, and it adds it to the main prime list. It then sums up the list of primes it created"

I use a while loop to check if the answer only has letters in it. Then I initialize the compressed list and set the counter to 0. I also initialize the previous_letter variable with the first letter in the word the user inputted. I then run a for loop to iterate through the string. If the letter is the same as the previous one, then the counter ticks up one and the \"previous_letter\" variable is set to the current letter. When it finds a new letter, it appends the previous letter plus the current state of the counter. It then resets the counter to 1 and goes to the next letter in the for loop. Finally, I add the last letter and counter state once the for loop finishes. I then check if the length of the list (converted to a string) is less than the original string. If it is, I return the compressed version; if not, I return the original string.\n",
