Finally, while solutions to problems like these may be found online, remember that if you copy/paste code that you can't explain, you'll be missing out on the point of the project. The only way to truly learn a new skill is through practice, trial, and error - we can only help you improve by understanding where you are having trouble."

For example, the string \"aabcccccaaa\" would become a2b1c5a3. If the “compressed” string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string.
